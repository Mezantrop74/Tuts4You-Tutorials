# 2021 update:

Will be creating a 2021 tuts4you rip as well as reaching out to other teams/sites to see if they would be intrested in a conservation/archival effort.

Would recommend pulling the 2011 data from the torrent listed below instead of this repo.

#### 2011 site rip https://forum.tuts4you.com/files/file/1865-tuts-4-you-collection-2011/

Base 16 Hash-ID

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:92DE6AD02A7BF83C1EE105DEC719741A8CCB7EC8
```

# Tuts4You-Tutorials
All tutorials from tuts4you from the 2011 Site Rip

Will be adding the rest of them with time along with sorting them.
